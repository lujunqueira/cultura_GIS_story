## 1. Research Design and Spatial Scope
This project examines how cultural participation varies across Brazil’s capital cities and how these differences relate to socioeconomic class and education.

The unit of spatial analysis is the Brazilian capitals (27 cities) represented as point features. The population universe is respondents aged 16 years and older, consistent with the survey design. Comparisons are conducted at two spatial scales:
•	City-level (capital-to-capital comparison)
•	Macro-regional (North, Northeast, Center-West, Southeast, South)

Mapping focuses on percentage-based indicators to ensure comparability across cities with different population sizes.

## 2. Data Source: Cultura nas Capitais (2024)
The analysis uses microdata from the 2024 Cultura nas Capitais survey, conducted by Datafolha for the project organizers, the Federal Government of Brazil, and JLeiva.

•	Conducted February–May 2024
•	Universe: residents aged 16+
