Variable,Raw field,Type,Values / categories,Description / notes
Nquest,Nquest,Integer,Unique ID,Respondent identifier from raw file. Primary key for joins across your derived tables.

City,Capital,Categorical (string),"26 named capitals + Brasília: São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Belo Horizonte, Brasília, Salvador, Recife, Fortaleza, Curitiba, Porto Alegre, Belém, Manaus, etc.","Capital name derived by recoding numeric Capital codes to labels (e.g., 100 → São Paulo, 500 → Rio de Janeiro, 4300 → Aracaju, etc.). This will be your join key to the capitals geometry after you standardize names on the GIS side."
Region,Regiao,Categorical (string),"Sudeste, Sul, Nordeste, Centro-Oeste, Norte",Macro-region classification recoded from numeric codes 1–5. Important for your regional comparison maps.
Age Group,Idade,Categorical (ordered),"16 a 24, 25 a 34, 35 a 44, 45 a 59, 60 +",Age bands for population 16+. Use this whenever you stratify or report age results; also relevant if you ever normalize within age groups.
Education Level,Escola1,Categorical (ordered),"Elementary, Secondary, Higher Education","Collapsed education variable: 1 = Elementary, 2 = Secondary, 3 = Higher Education. This is your main education indicator for maps and analysis."
Socioeconomic Class,Rclasse2,Categorical (ordered),"A, B1, B2, C1, C2, D/E",AB class system; recoded from numeric codes 1–6. This is the cleanest social class variable; you’ll normalize these by population 16+ at city level.

Ethnicity,Cor,Categorical,"White, Black, Mixed, Asian, Indigenous",Self-declared color/race. Recoded from numeric codes 1–5.
Marital Status,Estcivil,Categorical,"Married, Single, Widowed, Separated","Standard marital status groups, recoded from codes 1–4. Mostly contextual."

Sexual Orientation,P55,Categorical,"LGBTQIAPN+, Heterosexual, Other","Recoding: several codes grouped to LGBTQIAPN+, 5 → Heterosexual, and specific residual codes mapped to Other. This is a simplified orientation axis, more for descriptive breakdowns than mapping."
Religion,Religiao1,Categorical,"Catholic, Evangelical, Spiritist | Kardecist, Afro-Brazilian, Atheist / No religion, Undefined, Other, NA",Heavily collapsed from many numeric codes into a small set of labels.

Children,Nfilhos,Categorical,"No children, Children",Derived indicator: if Nfilhos == 96 → No children; else Children
Internet Access,P18,Categorical (ordered-ish),"Always connected, Almost always connected, Sometimes connected, Never connected","Recoding: 1=Always, 2=Almost always, 3–4 both → Sometimes connected, 96=Never connected. This is your structural access proxy when interpreting digital vs physical cultural participation."
